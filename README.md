AI-based Travel Planner Agent Project using foundation model (simulated output)
This project demonstrates an AI-powered Travel Planner Agent that helps users plan personalized, budget-friendly trips based on destination, duration, and constraints. The assistant uses natural language understanding and foundation model reasoning to generate day-wise itineraries.

## 💡 Objective

To simulate the behavior of an AI agent developed using IBM Watsonx.ai and foundation models such as llama-3.3-70b-instruct, capable of producing structured, budget-conscious travel plans with minimal input.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- IBM Watsonx.ai Studio (conceptual)
- IBM Watsonx.ai Runtime
- Foundation model (prompt-based simulation)
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Cloud Object Storage (planned but not accessed)
