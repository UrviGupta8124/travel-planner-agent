AI-based Travel Planner Agent Project using foundation model (simulated output)
This project demonstrates an AI-powered Travel Planner Agent that helps users plan personalized, budget-friendly trips based on destination, duration, and constraints. The assistant uses natural language understanding and foundation model reasoning to generate day-wise itineraries.

## 💡 Objective

To simulate the behavior of an AI agent developed using IBM Watsonx.ai and foundation models such as Mistral-large, capable of producing structured, budget-conscious travel plans with minimal input.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- IBM Watsonx.ai Studio (conceptual)
- IBM Watsonx.ai Runtime (not accessible due to Lite plan limits)
- Foundation model (prompt-based simulation)
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Cloud Object Storage (planned but not accessed)

## 📁 Project Contents

- `Presentation.pdf` – Final presentation summarizing the project
- `Simulated_Output/`
  - `prompt.txt` – User input for AI agent
  - `response.txt` – Generated output (itinerary)
  - `screenshots/` – Screenshots of prompt and response for results section
- `Notes/platform_limitations.txt` – Explanation of IBM Cloud issues

## 📌 Note on Simulation

Due to technical limitations accessing IBM Watsonx.ai runtime and Prompt Lab under the Lite plan, the AI output was simulated to represent the expected behavior of the Travel Planner Agent. The generated results reflect what would be produced using a foundation model.
